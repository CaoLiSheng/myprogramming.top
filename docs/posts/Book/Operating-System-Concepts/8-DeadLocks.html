Deadlock is only possible when all four conditions are present.</li><li>Deadlocks can be modeled with resource-allocation graphs, where a cycle indicates deadlock.</li><li>Deadlocks can be prevented by ensuring that one of the four necessary conditions for deadlock cannot occur. Of the four necessary conditions, eliminating the circular wait is the only practical approach.</li><li>Deadlock can be avoided by using the banker's algorithm, which does not grant resources if doing so would lead the system into an unsafe state where deadlock would be possible.</li><li>A deadlock-detection algorithm can evaluate processes and resouces on a running system to determine if a set of processes is in a deadlock state.</li><li>If deadlock does occur, a system can attempt to recover from the deadlock by either aborting one of the processes in the circular wait or preempting resources that have been assigned to a deadlock process.</li></ul><h2 id="bi-ji-mu-lu">笔记目录</h2><ol start="0"><li><a href="scroll-to-the-very-top">回到开头</a></li></ol><br /><br /><hr /><br /><div class="comments"><a href="mailto:954382491@qq.com?subject=评价「读书笔记之《Operating System Concepts》8」">来聊两句吧～</a><h6 class="tip">⚠️ 请先安装一款邮件软件（部分浏览器可能不支持，请使用设备默认浏览器打开本页面）</h6></div><br /></article>
