Race conditions can result in corrupted values of shared data.</li><li>A critical section is a section of code where shared data may be manipulated and a possible race condition may occur. The critical-section problem is to design a protocol whereby processes can synchronize their activity to cooperatively share data.</li><li>A solution to the critical-section problem must satisfy the following three requirements: (1) mutual exclusion, (2) progress, and (3) bounded waiting. Mutual exclusion ensures that only one process at a time is active in its critical section. Progress ensures that programs will cooperatively determine what process will next enter its critical section. Bounded waiting limits how much time a program will wait before it can enter its critical section.</li><li>Software solutions to the critical-section problem, such as Peterson's solution, do not work well on modern computer architectures.</li><li>Hardware support for the critical-section problem includes memory barriers; hardware instructions, such as the compare-and-swap instruction; and atomic variables.</li><li>A mutex lock provides mutual exclusion by requiring that a process acquire a lock before entering a critical section and release the lock on exiting the critical section.</li><li>Semaphores, like mutex locks, can be used to provide mutual exclusion. However, whereas a mutex lock has a binary value that indicates if the lock is available or not, a semaphore has an integer value and can therefore be used to solve a variety of synchronization problems.</li><li>A monitor is an abstract data type that provides a high-level form of process synchronization. A monitor uses condition variables that allow processes to wait for certain conditions to become true and to signal one another when conditions have been set to true.</li><li>Solutions to the critical-section problem may suffer from liveness problems, including deadlock.</li><li>The various tools that can be used to solve the critical-section problem as well as to synchronize the activity of processes can be evaluated under varying levels of contention. Some tools work better under certain contention loads than others.</li></ul><h2 id="bi-ji-mu-lu">笔记目录</h2><ol start="0"><li><a href="scroll-to-the-very-top">回到开头</a></li></ol><br /><br /><hr /><br /><div class="comments"><a href="mailto:954382491@qq.com?subject=评价「读书笔记之《Operating System Concepts》6」">来聊两句吧～</a><h6 class="tip">⚠️ 请先安装一款邮件软件（部分浏览器可能不支持，请使用设备默认浏览器打开本页面）</h6></div><br /></article>
